# SPR_affinity_calculation
The code aims to import an excel file, perform fit on the K_on region of the SPR data, find the maximum response unit from fitting across multiple concentration of analyte, then use Langmuir isotherm equation to find the maximum response, then extract affinity data from this fit.
